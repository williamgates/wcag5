The command line needs to include two parameters for the starting URL and the number of pages to crawl.
It should look something like this:

casperjs wcagtest.js http://overdrive.com/ 10

To view results in your browser:
1. git clone https://github.com/williamgates/wcag5.git
2. cd into wcag5
3. run npm install
4. run node index.js 
5. This should serve the page at http://localhost:3000
